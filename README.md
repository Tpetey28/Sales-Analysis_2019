# Sales-Analysis_2019


In this project, I analyze 12 months worth of sales data using Python. I leverage the pandas module to first perform 
data cleansing and formatting to set up my analysis. My analysis answers several business questions. A few of the 
basic questions my project answers are: 

  1. In which month did we achieve the highest sales? 
  2. 2. Which city had the highest sales? 
  3. 3. Which products were our most popular? 

In addition to these basic questions, this project also answers a few more advanced questions: \
  1. What time should we display advertisements to achieve maximum likelihood for converting those ads into sales? 
  2. 2. Which products are sold most often together?

This project is created using sample data found on Kaggle and does not reflect the actual sales of any organization 
that I worked with. However, this project demonstrates my ability to utilize Python to analyze data and deliver 
insights that will benefit the business.
